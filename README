This is an IoT project conducted by students of the UAS JOANNEUM as part of the bachelor's programme of [Information Management](https://www.fh-joanneum.at/informationsmanagement/bachelor/).

# Responsible Persons
@AnotherCodeArtist is the Mentor and guiding person of this project.

@GregorFernbach is responsible for the ingestion and stream processing of the MQTT IoT data. His tasks are to find a MQTT broker product, deploy it and configure it to have a connection to the JMeter script which will provice the data.
Moreover the broker should have a connection to the Stream processing engine (Apache Flink). When the data enters the stream processing engine it should also be sinked in a Time-Serie Database (InfluxDB). Thus a
connector in Apache Flink to the InfluxDB is needed.
